# FREEFLOW

	Welcome to FreeFlow. This application is still in production, but we are happy to have anyone on board to assist us. Our goal is to have the site live by the end of this year with minimal functionality to begin with.

	FreeFlow is a Social Media Network which connects users based on their skills and assets to others that have specific wants and needs. Users can surf the dashboard or userlist to find others that need or want something that they can offer. When a user helps another out, they gain points. As they gain more points they will become more eligible to be helped by others.

	There is a gaming aspect involved in this app, as the points will become a ranking system which gives users more privileges to make bigger asks. There will be an achievements feature implemented in the near future which gives users more points, as well as skill levels for any skills a user may have (which can be just about anything). The intention is to make the app fun for users to interact with each other and perpetuate their desire to help others and gain ranks, skill levels and achievements.

	If you have anymore questions, or would like to know more about the app's functionality you can email the founder at mathiusjohnsondeveloper@gmail.com.
